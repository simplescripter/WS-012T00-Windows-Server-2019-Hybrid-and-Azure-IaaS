# Lab answer key: Using Windows Admin Center in hybrid scenarios

## Exercise 1: Provisioning Azure VMs running Windows Server 2019

### Task 1: Create an Azure resource group by using an Azure Resource Manager template

1. On SEA-CL1, start Microsoft Edge, navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and sign in by using credentials of a user account with the Owner role in the subscription you'll be using in this lab.
1. In the Azure portal, open **Cloud Shell** blade by selecting on the toolbar icon directly next to the search textbox.
1. If prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **PowerShell**.

    >**Note**: If this is the first time you are starting **Cloud Shell** and you are presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, select the subscription you are using in this lab, and select **Create storage**.
1. In the toolbar of the Cloud Shell blade, select the **Upload/Download files** icon, in the drop-down menu select **Upload**, and upload the file **M03-lab-sub_template.json** into the Cloud Shell home directory.
1. From the Cloud Shell blade, run the following to create a resource group that will contain resources you provision in this lab (replace the `<Azure region>` placeholder with the name of the Azure region that is available in your subscription and which is closest to the location of your lab computer):

   ```pwsh
   $location = '<Azure region>'
   New-AzSubscriptionDeployment `
     -Location $location `
     -Name ws2019-m031subDeployment `
     -TemplateFile $HOME/M03-lab-sub_template.json `
     -rgLocation $location `
     -rgName 'ws2019-m031-rg'
   ```
      >**Note**: To identify Azure regions where you can provision Azure VMs, refer to [Find Azure credit offers in your region](https://aka.ms/regions-offers).

### Task 2: Create an Azure VM by using an Azure Resource Manager template

1. From the Cloud Shell blade, upload an Azure Resource Manager template **M03-lab-rg_template.json**, which can be found at C:\Labfiles\Mod03.
1. From the Cloud Shell blade, upload an Azure Resource Manager parameter file **M03-lab-rg_template.parameters.json**.
1. From the Cloud Shell blade, run the following to deploy a Azure VM running Windows Server 2019 that you'll be using in this lab:

   ```pwsh
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
     -Name ws2019-m031rgDeployment `
     -ResourceGroupName 'ws2019-m031-rg' `
     -TemplateFile $HOME/M03-lab-rg_template.json `
     -TemplateParameterFile $HOME/M03-lab-rg_template.parameters.json
   ```

    >**Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete before you proceed to the next exercise. The deployment should take less than 5 minutes.
