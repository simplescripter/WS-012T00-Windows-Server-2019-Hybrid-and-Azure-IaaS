# Lab: Using Azure Security Center in hybrid scenarios

## Scenario

To identify Microsoft Azure security-related integration features with which you can further enhance your on-premises security environment, you have decided to add servers in your proof-of-concept environment to Security Center.

Your goal is to onboard on-premises servers that are running Windows Server 2019 into Security Center and then verify the hybrid capabilities of Security Center.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

- Configure Security Center.
- Onboard on-premises Windows Server 2019 computers into Security Center.
- Verify the hybrid capabilities of Security Center.

## Estimated time: 45 minutes

## Lab setup

Lab virtual machines: **SEA-CL1**, **SEA-DC1**, **SEA-SVR1**, and **SEA-SVR2**
Username: **Administrator**
Password: **Pa55w.rd**

For this lab, you'll use the available virtual machine (VM) environment and an Azure subscription. Before you begin the lab, complete the following steps:

1. Ensure that you have an Azure subscription and a user account with the Owner or Contributor role in that subscription.
1. Start the VMs.

## Exercise 1: Provisioning Azure VMs running Windows Server 2019

### Scenario

You must test Security Center functionality in hybrid scenarios, including its benefits for Azure VMs that are running Windows Server 2019. To start, you'll provision Azure VMs that are running Windows Server 2019 by using an Azure Resource Manager template.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Start Azure Cloud Shell.
1. Create an Azure VM by using Resource Manager templates.

### Task 1: Start Azure Cloud Shell

1. Sign in to **SEA-CL1** as **Contoso\\\\Administrator** with password **Pa55w.rd**.
1. Open Microsoft Edge, and then browse to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Sign in by using the credentials that you created for this course.
1. In the Azure portal, select **Cloud Shell**.
1. Select **PowerShell**.
1. When prompted, verify that your subscription is chosen, and then select **Create storage**.

### Task 2: Create an Azure VM by using Resource Manager templates

**Upload the Resource Manager templates**

1. In Cloud Shell, select **Upload/Download files**, and then select **Upload**.
1. Browse to the **c:\\labfiles\\mod04** folder.
1. Select the **M04-lab-rg_template.json** file, and then select **Open**.
1. Repeat steps 1 through 3 for the following files:

   - **M04-lab-rg_template.parameters.json**
   - **M04-lab-sub_template.json**

**Create a resource group**

1. In Cloud Shell, enter the following command, replacing *\<region>* with an Azure region that's close to you:

    ```powershell
    New-AzSubscriptionDeployment -Location '<region>' -Name ws2019-m04deployment -TemplateFile ./M04-lab-sub_template.json -rgLocation '<region>' -rgName 'm04-rg'
    ```

**Create a Windows Server VM**

1. In Cloud Shell, enter the following command:

    ```powershell
    New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -Name windows-m04rgDeployment -ResourceGroupName m04-rg -TemplateFile ./M04-lab-rg_template.json -TemplateParameterFile ./M04-lab-rg_template.parameters.json
    ```

1. Close Cloud Shell.
1. Wait for deployment to complete.

> **Note:** You can close Cloud Shell before deployment is complete.

## Exercise 2: Configuring Azure Security Center

### Scenario

1. On the **Upgrade** tab of the **Getting started** pane, for **Enable standard tier on 1 subscriptions**, select your subscription.
1. Select **Upgrade**.
1. Select **Continue without installing agents**.

### Task 2: Turn on automatic provisioning of the Log Analytics agent

1. Browse back to Security Center.
1. In Security Center, select **Pricing & settings**, select your subscription, and then select **Data Collection**.
1. In the **Auto Provisioning** section, select **On**.
1. In the **Workspace configuration** section, verify that **Use workspace(s) created by Security Center (default)** is selected, and then select **Save**.
1. Refresh the page, and then browse back to the **Data Collection** page.
1. In the **Windows security events** section, select **All Events**, and then select **Save** again.

> **Note:** It might take up to 30 minutes for the **Log Analytics** workspace to be created after selecting **Save** in step 4. You might need to refresh the page several times before the option to select **All Events** is available. Continue only after you're able to select **All events** and save the setting.

### Task 3: Review the features and capabilities that apply to hybrid scenarios

1. In the **RESOURCE SECURITY HYGIENE** section of Security Center, select **Compute & apps**.
