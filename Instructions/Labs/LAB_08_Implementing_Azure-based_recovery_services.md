## Scenario 
To address concerns regarding the outdated operational model, the limited use of automation, and reliance on tape backups for restores and disaster recovery, you decide to use Azure-based recovery services. As the first step, you'll implement Azure Site Recovery and Azure Backup.

## Objectives
After completing this lab, you'll be able to: 

- Implement the lab environment.
- Create and configure an Azure Site Recovery vault.
- Implement Hyper-V VM protection by using Azure Site Recovery vault.
- Implement Azure Backup.
- Deprovision the Azure lab environment.

## Estimated time: 60 minutes

## Lab setup
Virtual machines: SEA-CL1 and SEA-DC1

User name: **Contoso\\Administrator**

Password: **Pa55w.rd**

## Exercise 1: Implementing the lab environment

### Scenario

You need to test a number of Azure VM backup and recovery scenarios. To start, you will provision an Azure VM running Windows Server 2019 with the Hyper-V role installed by using an Azure Quickstart template. You will then install Hyper-V VM running Windows Server 2019 within that Azure VM. 

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

   Get-AzResourceGroup -Name 'ws2019-08-*' | Remove-AzResourceGroup -Force -AsJob
   ```

   > **Note: **The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the *-AsJob* parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately after within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.
